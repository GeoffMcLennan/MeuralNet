# MeuralNet

## Getting it running
Every time the application is started it looks for an starting seed XML file. If no XML is found, it will use the training/testing data to generate a new XML seed file. This can take 2-3 minutes depending on your machine.

Once a neural net has been loaded the drawing application can be used. Draw in the panel on the left and click "Evaluate" and the program will guess what number you drew. Click "Correct" or "Incorrect" depending on the output, or ignore if you don't like your drawing.
